    <p>
        The threat of hackers and crackers is for real, and is alike for everything for everyone.<br>
        If the security breach at the Babha Atomic Research Center last year by the hacker group <b>milworm</b> didnâ€™t convince you of their capabilities, then consider this:<br>
        James Davis aka <i>jdavis_a</i>, a resident of <u>www.geocities.com/SiliconValley/Bit/2483</u> homestead community on the Internet,<br>
        might just be reading your e-mail in your mailbox right now, or using your account for some benign Internet surfing,<br>
        or exchanging it with someone else on the Net for more such accounts!

        <i>Surprised? Or scared?</i>

    <p>
        <b>Formula:</b><br>
        (a - b)<sup>2</sup> = a<sup>2</sup> - 2ab + b<sup>2</sup><br>
        C<sub>6</sub>H<sub>12</sub>O<sub>6</sub> + 6O<sub>2</sub>
    </p>

        Whatever it is, <i>jdevis_4</i> claims in his home page <b>Free VSNL passwords</b> that he has got exactly<br>
        <font color="blue">108 working passwords</font> (and growing daily),<br>
        36 satyam, 31 MNTL, 11 WimiNet and 23 online passwords.
